# This file describes the converter and its arguments to tell the driver how to construct the UI

## The first block gives the name, namespace, version, and description of the converter
name: quality_made_xlsx                           # Any valid python key (should be unique)
namespace: mines/xlsx                             # folder-like grouping that can be used across multiple ingesters
displayName: "Mines: Quality Made XLSX Ingester"  # The name that is displayed on the website
version: auto                                     # Auto will pull the version from setup.py
description: Ingester for XLSX metadata files.    # Any string

## The second block lists the arguments, specifying their names, descriptions, types, 
## any default values, and whether they are required or optional.
##
## Supported primitive types:
##  - String
##  - Boolean
##  - Integer
##  - Real (which is a float)
##
## There is also support for fixed-size lists with the form List[size][type].  For
## example, List[3][Real] would be a 3 length list.  Multi-dimensional lists are not currently
## supported.
#arguments:                  # These are the arguments for the convert method
#- name: important_argument          # each argument has a name (must be a valid python key)
#  desc: A really important argument # and a description (any string)
#  type: Integer                     # this is the type of the argument (see above)
#  required: true                    # and whether or not the argument is required
#
#- name: whatever_argument # Any number of arguments can be specified
#  desc: A less important argument
#  type: List[3][Real] # this is a 3-length list
#  default: # With default values
#    - 0.0
#    - 1.0
#    - 2.0
#  required: true # defaults are only supported for required arguments
#
#- name: do_some_extra_thing # Here's an example for a boolean
#  desc: Run some additional preprocessing on something
#  type: Boolean
#  default: false
#  required: true
#
#- name: some_condition
#  desc: The condition of the data, if known
#  type: String
#  required: false # the condition might not be known, so it doesn't need to be specified
